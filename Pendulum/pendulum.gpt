write a sage math script to plot the motion of a double pendulum with
equal point masses and equal length strings, assuming no friction, no
drag

start one pendulum at pi/2 and the other at pi/4

plot the x-y coordinates of both pendulums

be sure to include a shebang line

use matplotlib.pyplot

output only the script without any commentary
