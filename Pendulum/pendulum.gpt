write a sage math script to plot the motion of a double pendulum with
equal point masses and equal length strings, assuming no friction, no
drag

start the upper pendulum at pi/2 and the lower one at pi/4

plot the x-y coordinates of both pendulums

plot for the number of seconds specified in the environment variable T

be sure to include a shebang line

use matplotlib.pyplot

solve the system of differential equations using odeint from scipy.integrate

output only the script without any commentary
